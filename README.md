Number Guess, This is one of the most basic of basic beginner projects for someone learning python, which is exactly why I added it. I personally find it facinating that python can go from simple games like this to more complex games with moving parts involving turtles.

TicTacToe was found on askpython from a person named Aprataksh Anand. Originally I was going to combine this and my old calculator program so I could draw it out in tkinter but I was informed that we were not allowed to use things we developed from previous courses. I have a fondness for tictactoe and would eventually like to make a bigger project involving it in the future.
