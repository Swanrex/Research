Number Guess, This is one of the most basic of basic beginner projects for someone learning python, which is exactly why I added it. I personally find it facinating that python can go from simple games like this to more complex games with moving parts involving turtles.

TicTacToe, Originally I was going to combine this and my old calculator program so I could draw it out in tkinter but I was informed that we were not allowed to use things we developed from previous courses. I have a fondness for tictactoe and would eventually like to make a bigger project involving it in the future.

Digital Clock, Though I stated this was impractical in the comments of the project I do still think this is a great show for turtles capabilities. I haven't seen the absolute limits of turtle yet but I think it can be used to create some pretty creative stuff perhaps even create art through inputs and randomisation.

Music Player, Couldn't get this to work no matter how much I tried but it was probably a VERY simple solution that I just ended up missing or accidentally mix with something else I was trying but once I get sufficiantly good enough at python I'd love to recreate this for myself. So I used this both for it's relevant complexity and because I want to attempt a recreation in the future.

Blackjack, as a fan of simple games I grew up playing card games like blackjack or hold em with my mates usually hold em because it was more intense but I decided to add Blackjack in here because of the calmer yet still fond memories I have of this rather than the hype of snatching away everyones food that we'd use instead of chips. I think projects involving ascii art are very impressive because of the effort that not only goes into the code processes but also the designing of the art, in my mind its the good middle ground between the full tkinter displays and basic console prints of projects.
