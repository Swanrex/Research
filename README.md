Number Guess, This is one of the most basic of basic beginner projects for someone learning python, which is exactly why I added it. I personally find it facinating that python can go from simple games like this to more complex games with moving parts involving turtles.

TicTacToe, Originally I was going to combine this and my old calculator program so I could draw it out in tkinter but I was informed that we were not allowed to use things we developed from previous courses. I have a fondness for tictactoe and would eventually like to make a bigger project involving it in the future.

Digital Clock, Though I stated this was impractical in the comments of the project I do still think this is a great show for turtles capabilities. I haven't seen the absolute limits of turtle yet but I think it can be used to create some pretty creative stuff perhaps even create art through inputs and randomisation.
